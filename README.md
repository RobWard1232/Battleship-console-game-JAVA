# Battleship-console-game-JAVA

This is a final project I have done for my AP Computer Science class in high school.
I am aware of several bugs such as the sub reporting where the ship is more than once, the nuke not really working except to show you where one is and if there are any near it. and a couple others.
I had 2 weeks to program this and overall I find it a success.

DIRECTIONS:
  enter your x and y coordinates in the console in this fasion: 4, 4
  if you do not than it will make you forfeit your turn and you will need to try again
  you can type in sub instead of a x and y coordinate and the game will tell you where one of the enemies ships are.
  you can type in nuke in order to show you a 3x3 explosion and it will show you if there is a ship within that area.
